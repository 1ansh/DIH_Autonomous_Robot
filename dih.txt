
#WEEK1-2
Collecting training sets for object detection and writing the code for Haar feature-based cascade classifiers.

#WEEK3-4
Classification the objects(Stop sign and traffic lights) would be done along with image processing tasks.

#WEEK5-6
Collecting training set for Neural Network training and making of the robot.

#WEEK7-8
Training of the Neural Network will be done.Once the network is trained, it only needs to load trained parameters afterwards, thus prediction can be very fast.

#WEEK8+
Additional features required for the project will be accomplished.
