Collecting training sets for object detection and writing the code for Haar feature-based cascade classifiers.

Classification the objects(Stop sign and traffic lights) would be done along with image processing tasks.

Collecting training set for Neural Network training and making of the robot.

Training of the Neural Network will be done.Once the network is trained, it only needs to load trained parameters afterwards, thus prediction can be very fast.

Additional features required for the project will be accomplished.
